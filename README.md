# Jamf Pro Manifests

These are some examples of [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html) manifests for use with Jamf Pro's Application & Custom Settings payload for Computer configuration profiles. Manifests are compatible with Jamf Pro 10.19 and later.

Some of these manifests were created using [Managed App Schema Builder](https://github.com/BIG-RAT/Managed-App-Schema-Builder/wiki). Many were tweaked slightly for better control over the appearance in Jamf Pro.

The manifest for [Disk Manager](https://github.com/Jamf-Custom-Profile-Schemas/jamf-manifests/blob/master/Disk%20Manager%20(net.talkingmoose.diskmanager).json) is for a fictitious app. It provides examples for a variety of options possible when creating properties in manifests. Paste it into the Custom Schema field of a new Jamf Pro Configuration Profile under Application & Custom Settings and click the Properties tab to view the forms created for each property. Use this as a template for creating your own manifests.

For information about how to use a Jamf manifest, see the [wiki](../wiki).
